<br>Maybe I came on too strong
<br>Maybe I waited too long
<br>Maybe I played my cards wrong
<br>Oh, just a little bit wrong 
<br>Baby I apologize for it
<br>I could fall, or I could fly
<br><br>
<br>Here in your aeroplane
<br>And I could live, I could die
<br>Hanging on the words you say
<br>And I’ve been known to give my all
<br><br>
<br>And jumping in harder than
<br>Ten thousand rocks on the lake
<br>So don’t call me baby
<br>Unless you mean it
<br><br>
<br>Don’t tell me you need me
<br>If you don’t believe it
<br>So let me know the truth
<br>Before I dive right into you
<br>You’re a mystery
<br>I have travelled the world, there’s no other girl like you
<br>No one, what’s your history?
<br>Do you have a tendency to lead some people on?
<br>'Cause I heard you do, mm
<br>I could fall, or I could fly
<br><br>
<br>Here in your aeroplane
<br>And I could live, I could die
<br>Hanging on the words you say
<br>And I’ve been known to give my all
<br><br>
<br>And lie awake, everyday don't know how much I can take
<br>So don’t call me baby
<br>Unless you mean it
<br>And don’t tell me you need me
<br>If you don’t believe it
<br>So let me know the truth
<br>Before I dive right into you
<br><br>
<br>I could fall, or I could fly
<br>Here in your aeroplane
<br>And I could live, I could die
<br>Hanging on the words you say
<br>And I’ve been known to give my all
<br>Sitting back, looking at every messy that I made
<br><br>
<br>So don’t call me baby
<br>Unless you mean it
<br>Don’t tell me you need me
<br>If you don’t believe it
<br>Let me know the truth
<br>Before I dive right into you
<b><br>
<br>Before I dive right into you
<br>Before I dive right into you
